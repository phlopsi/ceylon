"""A string of characters. Each character in the string 
   is a [[32-bit Unicode character|Character]]. The 
   UTF-16 encoding of the underlying native string is 
   hidden from clients.
   
   Literal strings may be written between double quotes:
   
       "hello world"
       "\r\n"
       "\{#03C0} \{#2248} 3.14159"
       "\{GREEK SMALL LETTER PI} \{ALMOST EQUAL TO} 3.14159"
   
   Alternatively, a _verbatim string_ may be written 
   between tripled double quotes.
   
   The _empty string_, `""`, is a string with no 
   characters.
   
   A string is a [[Category]] of its [[characters]], and 
   of its substrings:
   
       'w' in greeting 
       "hello" in greeting
   
   Strings are [[summable|Summable]]:
   
       String greeting = "hello" + " " + "world";
   
   They are efficiently [[iterable|Iterable]]:
   
       for (char in "hello world") { ... }
   
   They are [[lists|List]] of [[characters|Character]]:
   
       value char = "hello world"[5];
   
   They are [[ranged|Ranged]]:
   
       String who = "hello world"[6...];
   
   Note that since `string[index]` evaluates to the 
   optional type `Character?`, it is often more 
   convenient to write `string[index..index]`, which 
   evaluates to a `String` containing a single character, 
   or to the empty string `""` if `index` refers to a 
   position outside the string.
   
   It is easy to use comprehensions to transform strings:
   
       String { for (s in "hello world") if (s.letter) s.uppercased }
   
   Since a `String` has an underlying UTF-16-encoded 
   native string, certain operations are expensive, 
   requiring iteration of the characters of the string. 
   In particular, [[size]] requires iteration of the 
   whole string, and `get()`, `span()`, and `measure()` 
   require iteration from the beginning of the string to 
   the given index."""

     The flags [[discardSeparators]] and [[groupSeparators]]
     determine how separator characters occur in the
     resulting stream. 
     
     - If `discardSeparators` is enabled, the stream 
       contains only _regular tokens_ containing 
       adjacent non-separator characters, and the 
       separator characters are simply discarded.
     - If `discardSeparators` is disabled, the string is 
       broken into regular tokens and _separator tokens_
       containing the separator characters. If 
       `groupSeparators` is disabled, the separator 
       tokens each contain a single character. If 
       `groupSeparators` is enabled, adjacent separator 
       characters are grouped into a single token.
     
     The [[limit]] determines the maximum number of 
     regular (non-separator) tokens that are returned in 
     the stream. If the limit is exceeded, the remainder 
     of the string is returned as a single token at the 
     end of the resulting stream. For example,
     
         \"foo bar baz fum\".split { limit = 2; }
     
     produces the stream `{ \"foo\", \"bar\", \"baz fum\" }`.
     
     If the first character of this string is a 
     separator character, the stream begins with an 
     empty token. Likewise, if the last character of 
     this string is a separator character, and the 
     `limit` is not reached, the stream ends with an 
     empty token.
     
     Note that for the case of the empty string, `split()` 
     always produces a stream containing a single empty 
     token. For example:
