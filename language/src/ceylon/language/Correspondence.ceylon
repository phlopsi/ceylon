"Abstract supertype of objects which associate values with 
 keys. A `Correspondence<Key,Item>` may be a viewed as a 
 partial function from domain `Key` to range `Item`, where
 some `Key`s have no `Item`.
 
 `Correspondence` does not satisfy [[Category]], since in 
 some cases&mdash;`List`, for example&mdash;it is convenient 
 to consider the subtype a `Category` of its indexed items, 
 and in other cases&mdash;`Map`, for example&mdash;it is 
 convenient to treat the subtype as a `Category` of its 
 [[entries|Entry]].
 
 The item corresponding to a given key may be obtained from 
 a `Correspondence` using the item operator:
 
     value bg = settings[\"backgroundColor\"] else white;
 
 The `get()` operation and item operator result in an
 optional type, to reflect the possibility that there may be
 no item for the given key."
