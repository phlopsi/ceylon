"""A 32-bit [Unicode][] character.
   
   Literal characters may be written between single quotes:
   
       ' '
       '\n'
       '\{#03C0}'
       '\{GREEK SMALL LETTER PI}'
   
   Every `Character` has a unique [[Integer]]-valued Unicode 
   _code point_.
   
       Integer piCodePoint = '\{GREEK SMALL LETTER PI}'.integer; // #03C0
       Character pi = #03C0.character; // GREEK SMALL LETTER PI
   
   Characters are [[Enumerable]], so character ranges may be
   produced using the [[measure]] and [[span]] operators.
   
       value lowerLatinLetters = 'a'..'z';
       value upperLatinLetters = 'A':26;
   
   Characters have a [[natural order|Comparable]] determined
   by their Unicode code points. So, for example, `'a'<'b'`,
   since `'a'.integer<'b'.integer`.

     Conversion of uppercase characters to lowercase is

     Furthermore, this conversion always produces a single
